= Dependencies =

* Ruby: http://ruby-lang.org/
* HAML: http://haml-lang.com/
* LESS: http://lesscss.org/
* YUI Compressor: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/
* 960 Grid System: http://960.gs/

= Recommendations = 

* ImageOptim: http://imageoptim.pornel.net/ I use this as a GUI tool for compressing images (especially sprited images),
  it can help reduce the file size even beyond what you get from photoshop's save for web tool.

= File Structure =

_source: files that will be used to build static HTML/CSS files
  _scripts: other scripts that are used in processing files
  haml: HAML markup files
  less: LESS css files
    open-source: any open-source CSS files that are used in the site
  psd: special-purpose PSD files used to create graphics that can't just be cut from the design mockups as-is 
  (sprited images, etc.)
www: where the compiled files will go, the idea is that anything that will be web-accessible or part of the template 
package will live in this directory.
  _res: resource files used for the template package
    css: cascading style sheets, any files in this directory should be minified.
      uncompressed: copies of the CSS files that have not been compressed/minified
    htc: any .htc behavior files that are used in internet explorer
    img: any images
      grid: images that show the grid columns from the 960 grid system
      fpo: images used for placement only (placeholders for images in content objects, etc.)
    js: javascript files, like with the CSS files anything in this directory should be compressed/minified
      uncompressed: the uncompressed and commented javascript files for the project.
    (as-needed) html: any HTML files only used under special circumstances (lightbox popup contents, etc.)
    (as-needed) swf: any flash SWF files used for the site
