*Small Tasks*

* include a copy of YUIcompressor.*.jar and change path for compression calls in build.rb
* see if there's a file path syntax that will work on windows as well as osx/*nix.

*Medium Tasks*

* rather than hard-coding files to change into the build script, set up a config file (YAML?) to define what files are processed as parts of each process.

*Unicorns and Rainbows*

* make a build script that loads HAML files into an object and then does their transformation within ruby itself rather than as a command line call. hopefully this would let me use actual variables/logic in the partials rather than having to process them out to flat files and include them all as-is.
